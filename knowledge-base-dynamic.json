However, hotels typically offer multiple rooms with varying rates based on their features and specifications. The RoomRates API is responsible for fetching comprehensive details for the various room options provided by the hotel.\nFAQs\nDoes the API return images for rooms?\nYes, the API does provide images for the rooms. It is available only if the suppliers provide this data.\nDoes the API return information about the charges to be paid at the property?\nYes, the API does provide information about additional charges that need to be paid at the property. It is available only if the suppliers provide this data.\nHow to use rate combinability type?\nRate combinability types determine how different hotel rates can be combined based on their RateCombinabilityId. Here’s how to use each type for use case of 2 rooms search:\nNone:\nDescription: Ignore these rates; they should not be combined with any other rates.\nExample: A rate with rateCombinabilityType: \"None\" should be ignored when combining.\nExample JSON:\nJSON\n{  \n    \"id\": \"11\",  \n    \"rateCombinabilityType\": \"None\",  \n    \"occupancies\": [  \n        {  \n            \"roomId\": \"1\"  \n        },  \n        {  \n            \"roomId\": \"1\"  \n        }  \n    ]  \n}\nGroupDifferentId:\nDescription: Combine rates with different RateCombinabilityIds.\nExample: Combine rates with id: 12 (RateCombinabilityId: \"456\") and id: 22 (RateCombinabilityId: \"789\").\nExample JSON:\nJSON\n{  \n    \"id\": \"12\",  \n    \"rateCombinabilityType\": \"GroupDifferentId\",  \n

Combine rates with the same RateCombinabilityId, excluding itself.\nExample: Rate with id: 23 (RateCombinabilityId: \"111\") can be combined with id: 24 and id: 14, which also have RateCombinabilityId: \"111\".\nExample JSON:\nJSON\n{  \n    \"id\": \"23\",  \n    \"rateCombinabilityType\": \"GroupWithinSameId\",  \n    \"rateCombinabilityId\": \"111\",  \n    \"occupancies\": [

It requires passing essential details such as passenger information, contact information, and payment information to facilitate the booking process for the selected hotel at the quoted price.\nBooking API details:\nHTTP:\nPOST\nEndpoint:\n: {baseEndpoint}/api/hotel/{hotelId}/{token}/book\nFAQs\nDo I need to pass a credit card to complete the booking?\nIt depends on your payment terms and account configurations with the supplier. If the supplier needs a credit card, you need to pass it in the Booking API. ZentrumHub API will forward that to the supplier. ZentrumHub Api does not store or charge the credit card.\nDo I need to pass the details of all the guests during the booking?\nThis depends on the allGuestInfoRequired field of the Price API response. If the value for this field is true, you need to pass the details of all the guests. Otherwise, the type and age (in case of a child) of the guests is enough.\nWhat should I do in case of a timeout error or non-confirmed booking status?\nSolution:\nTo ensure seamless booking experiences, we recommend implementing a polling mechanism in your booking process. Here's how it works:\nError Handling on Timeout: Upon encountering a timeout error or receiving a non-confirmed booking status in the response, your system should initiate the following steps:\nPolling Calls to getBookingDetails API: Make successive calls to the getBookingDetails API at intervals of 10 seconds.\nPolling Time Limit: Continue polling for a maximum duration of 5 minutes (30 polling attempts).\nConfirmation Check: Check the booking status received from each polling call. If the status is confirmed, proceed with the booking process as usual.\nHandling Non-Confirmation: If the booking status remains unconfirmed after 5 minutes of polling, implement appropriate error handling mechanisms on your end. This may include informing users about the status and advising them on further steps.\nBenefits of Implementation:\nMinimizes the risk of failed bookings due to timeout errors.\nEnsures that clients receive accurate booking statuses promptly.\nReduces the occurrence of duplicate bookings and associated complications.\nConclusion: Implementing a polling mechanism as part of your error handling strategy will significantly enhance the reliability and efficiency of your booking process, providing a seamless experience for both your clients and end-users.\nError Codes\nError Code\nError Message\n4000\nMandatory fields are missing in the request - {0}\n4001\nInvalid data in request - Please refer to the fields[] for more details.\n4004\nThe hotel you selected is sold out\n4005\nPrice for the selected room(s) has changed\n4006\nThe rate you tried to book has expired.

However, hotels typically offer multiple rooms with varying rates based on their features and specifications. The RoomRates API is responsible for fetching comprehensive details for the various room options provided by the hotel.\nRoomsRates API details:\nHTTP\n: POST\nEndpoint\n: {baseEndpoint}/api/hotel/{hotelId}/roomsandrates/{token}\nThe RoomsRates API provides the following details:\nRooms\n: It contains the details about the room such as name, description, facilities, bed info, area of the room.\nRates\n: It contains the details about the rates of the rooms offered by the hotel such as total rate, base rate, taxes, fee, refundability info, cancellation policies info and many more.\nRecommendations\n:\nEach recommendation corresponds to a specific rate for a room within the\nrates\narray.\nYou should use recommendation as it used for displaying the pricing information and it helps grouping of different rates belonging to the same room type i.e. a same room can have multiple rates such as refundable and non-refundable rates. The recommendationId provided in the response is used in the Price API for pricing.\nStandardized Rooms\n: Standardized rooms offer unified information by normalizing room data from multiple suppliers.\nThe standardized rooms is included in the\nroomsandrates\nresponse if you have subscribed to the room mapping service with ZentrumHub.\nFAQs\nFor how long is the token that we received in the response valid?\nThe token is valid for 60 minutes.\nDoes the API return images for rooms?\nYes, the API does provide images for the rooms. It is available only if the suppliers provide this data.\nDoes the API return information about the charges to be paid at the property?\nYes, the API does provide information about additional charges that need to be paid at the property. It is available only if the suppliers provide this data.\nHow do I translate recommendations to display rooms and rates in case of single room search?

In the below example, in the\nrecommendations\narray, the object with\nrecommendationId: \"e937dcff-18a3-4c3d-82b6-b1771144c8af\"\ncontains an array of\nrates\n. This array includes the\nrateId: \"a5f9c0f4-2d1b-43e5-827a-46e4a538d6c7\"\n, which can be used to find the corresponding rate object in the\nrates\narray at the\nroomsandrates\nresponse level by matching the\nrateId\nto the\nid\nof the rate object. You can repeat this process for the other recommendation objects in the\nrecommendations\narray.\nMapping of rates to standardizedRooms:\nEach rate has a reference to the room it belongs to. This information can be found in the occupancies array inside that given rate. Below is an example for the same rate\nrateId: \"a5f9c0f4-2d1b-43e5-827a-46e4a538d6c7\"\nas received in the response.

(In case when room mapping service is opted).\nMapping of recommendation to rates:\nIn the case of multiroom, for each recommendation object, there would be corresponding rates for both rooms. In the example below, you'll see that in the\nrecommendations\narray, the object with\nrecommendationId: \"e58e452e-bfec-419b-a39b-9e354f5f9bf8\"\ncontains an array of\nrates\n.

You can repeat this process for the other recommendation objects in the\nrecommendations\narray.\nMapping of rates to standardizedRooms:\nOnce you have the rates for a given recommednation, you can find the rooms for the recommendation by referencing the stdRoomId information from corresponding rates.
