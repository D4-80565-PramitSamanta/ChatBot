This API provides data on hotel names, facilities, images, star ratings, review ratings, addresses, and contact information, among other details. Furthermore, it supports advanced geographical search options, including polygon, circular region, and multi-polygon searches, allowing for precise location-based queries. Users can also search using specific hotel IDs, facilitating quick access to detailed information about particular properties. This rich and varied content ensures that users have all the necessary information at their fingertips, making the Static Content API an invaluable resource for applications requiring detailed hotel property data.\nStatic Content API Details:\nHTTP:\nPOST\nEndpoint:\n{baseEndpoint}/api/content/hotelcontent/getHotelContent\nFAQs\nWhat values are supported for the contentFields parameter?\nThe contentFields parameter supports the following values:\nBasic, All, Facilities, MasterFacilities, NearByAttractions, Policies, Images, CheckInCheckout, Descriptions, Neighbourhoods, Fees, Reviews, Rooms\nHotel content request - in the contentFields, are there options in addition to below pasted from the request sample? What does \"basic\" include?\nBelow are the details provided under basic:\nCategory, ChainCode, ChainName, Contact, Distance, GeoCode, HeroImage, Id, Language, Name, ProviderHotelId, ProviderId, ProviderName, RelevanceScore, Website, Type, StarRating, ImageCount, RatePlanTypes, Attributes\nWhat does contentFields=All return?\nThe All value returns all available content for a hotel. It is equivalent to combining all other contentFields values.\nIf you want additional fields with Basic, you can combine them in one request, This will return Basic fields plus Facilities and Images in a single response.\nHotel static content - is there an option to download static content on a regular basis, or does it have to be retrieved via the Get Hotel Content API as part of the booking workflow? There is some basic content that we need locally based on the way our product is architected today, including hotel id, hotel name, hotel address, star rating, latitude/longitude, phone number.\nWe don't have any API on our end to allow downloading static content.\nYou will need to use the getHotelContent API to fetch hotel content details.\nYou will find all the basic details of the hotels in the response.\nDoes the API support the biasing of search results?\nYes, the Content API returns a relevance score for each hotel based on pre-configured biasing rules. These rules can be set up in the hotel's static content fields. The results can be sorted based on the relevance score. The hotels with the highest relevance score can be displayed at the top of the list.\nIf the same hotel is available from multiple suppliers, how can I display the static content for that hotel?\nThe API returns static content from a single supplier. The supplier is decided based on the pre-configured supplier preferencing for static content. Alternatively, you can also provide the supplier preferences in the request in the providerPrefs field.\nError Codes\nError Code\nError Message\n4001\nInvalid data in request - Please refer to the fields[] for more details.\n5000\nYour request failed due to an unknown system error.

However, hotels typically offer multiple rooms with varying rates based on their features and specifications. The RoomRates API is responsible for fetching comprehensive details for the various room options provided by the hotel.\nRoomsRates API details:\nHTTP\n: POST\nEndpoint\n: {baseEndpoint}/api/hotel/{hotelId}/roomsandrates/{token}\nThe RoomsRates API provides the following details:\nRooms\n: It contains the details about the room such as name, description, facilities, bed info, area of the room.\nRates\n: It contains the details about the rates of the rooms offered by the hotel such as total rate, base rate, taxes, fee, refundability info, cancellation policies info and many more.\nRecommendations\n:\nEach recommendation corresponds to a specific rate for a room within the\nrates\narray.\nYou should use recommendation as it used for displaying the pricing information and it helps grouping of different rates belonging to the same room type i.e. a same room can have multiple rates such as refundable and non-refundable rates. The recommendationId provided in the response is used in the Price API for pricing.\nStandardized Rooms\n: Standardized rooms offer unified information by normalizing room data from multiple suppliers.\nThe standardized rooms is included in the\nroomsandrates\nresponse if you have subscribed to the room mapping service with ZentrumHub.\nFAQs\nFor how long is the token that we received in the response valid?\nThe token is valid for 60 minutes.\nDoes the API return images for rooms?\nYes, the API does provide images for the rooms. It is available only if the suppliers provide this data.\nDoes the API return information about the charges to be paid at the property?\nYes, the API does provide information about additional charges that need to be paid at the property. It is available only if the suppliers provide this data.\nHow do I translate recommendations to display rooms and rates in case of single room search? (In case when room mapping service is opted).\nEach recommendation corresponds to a specific rate for a room within the\nrates\narray.\nYou should use recommendation as it used for displaying the pricing information and it helps grouping of different rates belonging to the same room type i.e. a same room can have multiple rates such as refundable and non-refundable rates.\nThe recommendationId provided in the response is used in the Price API for pricing.\nMapping of recommendation to rates:\nEach recommendation would have an array of rates associated with it. In the below example, in the\nrecommendations\narray, the object with\nrecommendationId: \"e937dcff-18a3-4c3d-82b6-b1771144c8af\"\ncontains an array of\nrates\n. This array includes the\nrateId: \"a5f9c0f4-2d1b-43e5-827a-46e4a538d6c7\"\n, which can be used to find the corresponding rate object in the\nrates\narray at the\nroomsandrates\nresponse level by matching the\nrateId\nto the\nid\nof the rate object. You can repeat this process for the other recommendation objects in the\nrecommendations\narray.\nMapping of rates to standardizedRooms:\nEach rate has a reference to the room it belongs to. This information can be found in the occupancies array inside that given rate. Below is an example for the same rate\nrateId: \"a5f9c0f4-2d1b-43e5-827a-46e4a538d6c7\"\nas received in the response. In the occupancy section of the rate, we have the\nstdRoomId\n, which can be referred to find the corresponding standardized room as received in the\nstandardizedRooms array\nThe consumer should display the rate information and corresponding standardized room information as explained above to display corresponding rooms and rates for a given recommendation.\nHow do I translate recommendations to display rooms and rates in case of a multi room search? (In case when room mapping service is opted).\nMapping of recommendation to rates:\nIn the case of multiroom, for each recommendation object, there would be corresponding rates for both rooms. In the example below, you'll see that in the\nrecommendations\narray, the object with\nrecommendationId: \"e58e452e-bfec-419b-a39b-9e354f5f9bf8\"\ncontains an array of\nrates\n. This array includes the\nrateIds: \"3c982735-24ef-4511-b9a0-24ca40d14253\" and \"b1550172-4fa8-4caa-a37a-b303d3b420f6\"\n, which can be used to find the corresponding rate objects in the\nrates\narray at the\nroomsandrates\nresponse level by matching the\nrateId\nto the\nid\nof the rate object. You can repeat this process for the other recommendation objects in the\nrecommendations\narray.\nMapping of rates to standardizedRooms:\nOnce you have the rates for a given recommednation, you can find the rooms for the recommendation by referencing the stdRoomId information from corresponding rates. For the example above, for both rates from given recommendation i.e.\nrateId: \"3c982735-24ef-4511-b9a0-24ca40d14253\" and \"b1550172-4fa8-4caa-a37a-b303d3b420f6\"\n, the corresponding room information can be found by looking at the corresponding stdRoomId inside the occupancies object of each rate.\nThe booking engine takes into account the combinability of rates as received from the supplier in a multiroom case scenario and groups the rates and recommendations accordingly.\nHow do I translate recommendations to rooms and rates in case of a single room search?
