      "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, **taxes** are defined as \"Tax amounts and details\".\n\nThe concept of **taxes** is a crucial part of the pricing structure and is closely related to the **baseRate**, **totalRate**, and the **isIncludedInBaseRate** fields to ensure accurate cost calculation.\n\n### Pricing and Tax Fields\n\nThe documentation outlines several key fields for understanding how taxes are handled:\n\n*   **baseRate**: The fundamental room rate *before* taxes and fees are added.\n*   **totalRate**: The complete rate *including* all applicable taxes and fees.\n*   **taxes**: An object containing the specific tax amounts and details.\n*   **fees**: An object containing additional fee amounts and details.\n\nA critical field for correctly calculating the final price is **isIncludedInBaseRate**.\n\n### Field Detail: isIncludedInBaseRate\n\nThis boolean field is essential for determining if a tax is already factored into the **baseRate** or if it needs to be added separately.\n\n*   **Field Name**: `isIncludedInBaseRate`\n*   **Data Type**: boolean\n*   **Description**: Indicates whether a particular fee, tax, or charge is already included in the base rate price displayed to the user.\n*   **Values**:\n    *   `true`: The tax is already included in the displayed **baseRate**. You do not need to add it again.\n    *   `false`: The tax is NOT included in the **baseRate**. You must add this amount to the **baseRate** to calculate the final price.\n\n> **Important Note:** You must always check the **isIncludedInBaseRate** field when calculating the total booking cost. This practice helps avoid surprising users with unexpected additional costs and ensures accurate price comparisons between different rates.\n\n### Common Use Cases for Taxes\n\nThe documentation highlights several common scenarios where the handling of taxes is important:\n\n*   City taxes that may or may not be included in the room rate.\n*   VAT/GST taxes that may be included or excluded depending on the supplier or region.\n\n### Applicable API Endpoints\n\nThe logic for handling **taxes** and the `isIncludedInBaseRate` field applies to the following API endpoints where pricing is returned:\n\n*   **Search Results API**: ` /api/hotel/search`\n*   **Rooms and Rates API**: `/api/hotel/{hotelId}/roomsandrates/{token}`\n*   **Price API**: `/api/hotel/{hotelId}/price/{recommendationId}`\n\nWhile the documentation defines **taxes** as \"Tax amounts and details,\" the specific structure and sub-fields of the **taxes** object (e.g., `taxType`, `amount`, `currency`) are not detailed in the provided context.",

      "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, **taxes** are a component of the pricing structure that contains tax amounts and details for a given hotel rate. This information is typically found within a `taxes` array in API responses.\n\nThe most critical aspect of handling taxes is determining whether they are already included in the `baseRate` or if they need to be added to calculate the final price. This is done using the **isIncludedInBaseRate** field.\n\n### Field Details: `taxes` Array\n\nThe `taxes` field is an array of objects, where each object represents a specific tax.\n\nHere is an example of an object you would find inside the `taxes` array:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"amount\": 2.26,\n  \"description\": \"tax_and_service_fee\",\n  \"isIncludedInBaseRate\": false\n}\n```\n\n**Fields within a tax object:**\n\n*   **amount**\n    *   **Data Type:** number\n    *   **Description:** The value of the tax.\n    *   **Example:** `2.26`\n*   **description**\n    *   **Data Type:** string\n    *   **Description:** A description of the tax.\n    *   **Example:** `\"tax_and_service_fee\"`\n*   **isIncludedInBaseRate**\n    *   **Data Type:** boolean\n    *   **Description:** This is a crucial field that indicates if the tax amount is already factored into the **baseRate**.\n    *   **Valid Values:**\n        *   `true`: The tax is already included in the displayed **baseRate**. You should not add this amount again.\n        *   `false`: The tax is **NOT** included in the **baseRate** and must be added to it to calculate the accurate total price.\n\n### How to Calculate Total Price with Taxes\n\nTo correctly calculate the total booking cost, you must always check the **isIncludedInBaseRate** field for each item in the `taxes` array.\n\n**Example from the documentation:**\n\nIf the API response includes:\n*   `baseRate`: `20.729`\n*   `taxes` array: `[ { \"amount\": 2.26, \"description\": \"tax_and_service_fee\", \"isIncludedInBaseRate\": false } ]`\n\nThe `isIncludedInBaseRate` value is `false`, which means the tax of `2.26` must be added to the `baseRate`.\n\n**Calculation:**\n`baseRate` (20.729) + `taxes` (2.26) = `totalRate` (22.989)\n\n> **Important Note:** Always check the `isIncludedInBaseRate` field to avoid surprising users with unexpected additional costs and to ensure accurate price comparisons between different rates.\n\n### Common Types of Taxes\n\nThe documentation notes that the `taxes` field can be used for various charges, including:\n*   City taxes\n*   VAT/GST taxes\n\n### Related Fields\n\n*   **baseRate**: The fundamental room rate before taxes and fees are added.\n*   **totalRate**: The complete rate including all applicable taxes and fees.\n*   **fees**: Additional fee amounts and details.\n*   **commission**: Agency commission details.\n*   **otherRateComponents**: Additional markups and fees.\n\n### Relevant API Endpoints\n\nYou will find the **taxes** array and the **isIncludedInBaseRate** field in the responses of the following API endpoints:\n\n*   **Search Results API**: `/api/hotel/search`\n*   **Rooms and Rates API**: `/api/hotel/{hotelId}/roomsandrates/{token}`\n*   **Price API**: `/api/hotel/{hotelId}/price/{recommendationId}`",

It allows you to compare the final price (**totalRate**) against the original published price to calculate and display savings to the end-user.\n\n### Common Scenarios and Examples\n\nThe value of **publishedRate** can vary depending on the type of rate you receive.\n\n*   **Standard Published Rate**:\n    *   **Value**: `307.971`\n    *   **Meaning**: The supplier's original published rate is $307.971.\n\n*   **Negotiated Rate (No Published Rate)**:\n    *   **Value**: `0`\n    *   **Meaning**: This is a negotiated or special rate for which no public published rate is available.\n\n*   **Discounted Rate**:\n    *   **Value**: `184.6`\n    *   **Meaning**: The supplier's published rate is $184.60, but you may be receiving a lower, discounted rate.\n\nIn another real-world example from the documentation, for a room where the final **totalRate** is `22.989`, the **publishedRate** is `37.05`, allowing you to show the customer a saving of \"43%\".\n\n### Implementation Notes\n\n> **Important**: When using this field, always consider the following implementation guidelines from the documentation:\n>\n> *   When **publishedRate** is `0`, it typically indicates a negotiated or special rate.\n> *   You should compare **publishedRate** with **totalRate** to show potential savings to customers (e.g., by displaying a \"You Save X%\" message).\n> *   Depending on the rate type (e.g., negotiated vs. standard), the **publishedRate** may be higher than or equal to the **totalRate**.\n\n### Related Fields\n\nThe **publishedRate** should be understood in the context of other pricing fields:\n\n*   **`baseRate`**: The fundamental room rate before taxes and fees are added.\n*   **`totalRate`**: The complete and final rate that includes all applicable taxes, fees, and other charges.\n*   **`type`**: The rate type (e.g., Published, Negotiated).\n*   **`distributionType`**: Describes how the rate is distributed.\n\n### API Endpoints\n\nYou can find the **publishedRate** field in the responses of the following ZentrumHub Hotel APIs:\n\n*   **Search Results API**\n    *   **Endpoint**: `/api/hotel/search`\n*   **Rooms and Rates API**\n    *   **Endpoint**: `/api/hotel/{hotelId}/roomsandrates/{token}`\n*   **Price API**\n    *   **Endpoint**: `/api/hotel/{hotelId}/price/{recommendationId}`",

    "data": {
      "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, **baseRate** is the fundamental room rate before any taxes, fees, commissions, or other charges are added. It serves as the starting point for calculating the final price (**totalRate**).\n\n### Field Details: `baseRate`\n\n*   **Field Name:** `baseRate`\n*   **Data Type:** `number`\n*   **Description:** The fundamental or updated room rate before taxes and fees.\n*   **Example Value:** `20.729`\n\n### Role in Price Calculation\n\nThe **baseRate** is the core price of the room. To calculate the final payable amount (**totalRate**), you must check other price components like **taxes**, **commission**, and **otherRateComponents** (e.g., markups) to see if they are already included in the **baseRate**.\n\nThis is determined by the **isIncludedInBaseRate** boolean field present within each of those components.\n\n*   If `isIncludedInBaseRate` is `true`, the charge is already accounted for in the **baseRate**.\n*   If `isIncludedInBaseRate` is `false`, the charge must be added to the **baseRate** to calculate the **totalRate**.\n\n> **Important Note on Calculation:**\n> The documentation provides a clear example of how the final price is calculated:\n> `baseRate (20.729) + taxes (2.26) = totalRate (22.989)`\n>\n> In another example, a markup is also added:\n> `baseRate (20.729) + taxes (2.26) + markup (1.869) = totalRate (22.989)`\n>\n> This demonstrates that you must sum the **baseRate** with all other components where `isIncludedInBaseRate` is `false`.\n\n### Related Fields\n\nThe **baseRate** is closely related to several other fields that are essential for understanding the complete pricing structure:\n\n*   **`totalRate`**: The complete rate including all applicable taxes and fees.\n*   **`publishedRate`**: The original rate published by the hotel or supplier, which can be used to show savings to a customer.\n*   **`taxes`**: An array of tax objects. Each object contains an `amount` and the critical `isIncludedInBaseRate` field.\n*   **`fees`**: An array of additional fee objects, each with an `amount` and `isIncludedInBaseRate` field.\n*   **`commission`**: An object detailing the agency commission, which also contains an `isIncludedInBaseRate` field.\n*   **`otherRateComponents`**: An array for additional charges like markups, where each component has an `amount` and an `isIncludedInBaseRate` field.\n\n### API Endpoints\n\nThe **baseRate** field appears in the responses of the following API endpoints:\n\n*   **Search Results API**: `GET /api/hotel/search`\n*   **Rooms and Rates API**: `GET /api/hotel/{hotelId}/roomsandrates/{token}`\n*   **Price API**: `GET /api/hotel/{hotelId}/price/{recommendationId}`",
