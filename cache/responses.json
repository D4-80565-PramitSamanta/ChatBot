    "question": "How do I search for hotels?",
    "input_type": "question",
    "data": {
      "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, you can search for hotel static content using the **Static Content API**. This API allows you to retrieve comprehensive details about hotel properties using various search methods, including geographical searches (polygon, circular, multi-polygon) and searches by specific hotel IDs.\n\nHere are the detailed specifications for the **Static Content API**:\n\n### **Static Content API**\n\nThe **Static Content API** delivers comprehensive static content details about hotel properties, such as names, facilities, images, star ratings, addresses, and contact information.\n\n*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`\n*   **Endpoint**: `{baseEndpoint}/api/content/hotelcontent/getHotelContent`\n\n#### **Request Parameters**\n\nThe documentation highlights the following parameters and fields that can be used in the request.\n\n> Note: The provided documentation does not detail the full request body structure for specifying geographical search criteria or a list of hotel IDs. It focuses on the `contentFields` and `providerPrefs` parameters.\n\n*   **contentFields** (string): Specifies which content blocks to return in the response.\n    *   **Supported Values**:\n        *   `Basic`: Returns a fundamental set of hotel details.\n        *   `All`: Returns all available content for a hotel. This is equivalent to requesting all other content fields combined.\n        *   `Facilities`\n        *   `MasterFacilities`\n        *   `NearByAttractions`\n        *   `Policies`\n        *   `Images`\n        *   `CheckInCheckout`\n        *   `Descriptions`\n        *   `Neighbourhoods`\n        *   `Fees`\n        *   `Reviews`\n        *   `Rooms`\n    *   You can combine values to get specific information. For example, requesting `Basic`, `Facilities`, and `Images` will return the basic hotel details plus the facilities and images in a single response.\n\n*   **providerPrefs** (array): Used to specify supplier preferences when the same hotel is available from multiple suppliers. The API returns static content from a single supplier, which is determined either by pre-configured preferencing or by the preferences provided in this field.\n\n#### **Response Details**\n\nThe response contains the hotel content details based on the requested `contentFields`.\n\n*   **Fields returned with `contentFields=Basic`**:\n    *   `Category`\n    *   `ChainCode`\n    *   `ChainName`\n    *   `Contact`\n    *   `Distance`\n    *   `GeoCode` (includes latitude/longitude)\n    *   `HeroImage`\n    *   `Id` (ZentrumHub's hotel ID)\n    *   `Language`\n    *   `Name`\n    *   `ProviderHotelId`\n    *   `ProviderId`\n    *   `ProviderName`\n    *   `RelevanceScore`\n    *   `Website`\n    *   `Type`\n    *   `StarRating`\n    *   `ImageCount`\n    *   `RatePlanTypes`\n    *   `Attributes`\n\n*   **Relevance Score**: The API returns a `relevanceScore` for each hotel, which is based on pre-configured biasing rules. You can sort the search results based on this score to display hotels with a higher relevance at the top of the list.\n\n#### **Use Cases from the Documentation**\n\n*   **Downloading Basic Content**: To get basic content for your local system (e.g., hotel ID, name, address, star rating, latitude/longitude, phone number), you must use the `getHotelContent` API. The documentation states there is no separate API for bulk-downloading static content. The `Basic` value for `contentFields` will provide most of these details.\n*   **Handling Multiple Suppliers**: If a hotel is available from multiple suppliers, the API returns static content from a single, preferred supplier. You can influence this selection by passing your supplier preferences in the `providerPrefs` field in the request.\n\n#### **Error Codes**\n\n*   **`4001`**: Invalid data in request - Please refer to the fields[] for more details.\n*   **`5000`**: Your request failed due to an unknown system error.

    "question": "what is totalrate?",
    "input_type": "question",
    "data": {
      "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, the **total rate** is a detail included within the **Rates** object of the **RoomRates API** response. It represents one of the pricing components for a room offered by the hotel.\n\nThe documentation does not provide a specific definition or a breakdown of what is included in the **total rate**. It is listed alongside other rate details such as base rate, taxes, and fees.\n\n### RoomRates API\n\nThe **RoomRates API** is used to fetch comprehensive details for the various room and rate options available at a specific hotel, going beyond the minimum rate information returned by the Search API.\n\n*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`\n*   **Endpoint**: `{baseEndpoint}/api/hotel/{hotelId}/roomsandrates/{token}`\n\n#### Response Details\n\nThe API response contains several key objects:\n\n*   **Rooms**: An array of objects containing details about each room, such as its name, description, facilities, bed information, and area. This is used when the room mapping service is not enabled.\n*   **Rates**: An array of objects containing detailed pricing information for the rooms. The documentation states this object includes:\n    *   **total rate**\n    *   base rate\n    *   taxes\n    *   fee\n    *   refundability info\n    *   cancellation policies info\n*   **Recommendations**: An array of recommended room/rate combinations. Each recommendation groups different rates (e.g., refundable and non-refundable) for the same room type.\n    *   The `recommendationId` from this object is used in the subsequent **Price API** call.\n    *   Each recommendation contains an array of `rateId`s that map to specific objects in the main **Rates** array.\n*   **Standardized Rooms**: An array of objects containing unified and normalized room data from multiple suppliers. This is only included in the response if you have subscribed to the room mapping service with ZentrumHub.\n\n#### Use Case: Displaying Rooms and Rates\n\nTo display room and rate information to a user, you must map the different parts of the response together.\n\n1.  **Start with a `recommendation`**: Each object in the **recommendations** array represents a purchasable option.\n2.  **Map to a `rate`**: Use the `rateId` from within a `recommendation` object to find the corresponding rate object in the top-level **rates** array. This object will contain the pricing details, including the **total rate**.\n3.  **Map to a `room`**: From the rate object, use the `stdRoomId` (if using room mapping) or `roomId` (if not) found in the `occupancies` array to find the corresponding room object in the **standardizedRooms** or **rooms** array, respectively. This provides the descriptive details of the room associated with that rate.\n\n> **Important Note**: The token received in the Search API response, which is used in the endpoint for this API call, is valid for 60 minutes.\n\n#### Error Codes\n\n*   **`4001`**: Invalid data in request - Please refer to the fields[] for more details.\n*   **`4004`**: The hotel you selected is soldout\n*   **`5000`**: Your request failed due to an unknown system error.
