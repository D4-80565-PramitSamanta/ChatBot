      "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, you can search for hotel static content using the **Static Content API**. This API allows you to retrieve comprehensive details about hotel properties using various search methods, including geographical searches (polygon, circular, multi-polygon) and searches by specific hotel IDs.\n\nHere are the detailed specifications for the **Static Content API**:\n\n### **Static Content API**\n\nThe **Static Content API** delivers comprehensive static content details about hotel properties, such as names, facilities, images, star ratings, addresses, and contact information.\n\n*   **HTTP Method**: `POST`\n*   **Endpoint**: `{baseEndpoint}/api/content/hotelcontent/getHotelContent`\n\n#### **Request Parameters**\n\nThe documentation highlights the following parameters and fields that can be used in the request.\n\n> Note: The provided documentation does not detail the full request body structure for specifying geographical search criteria or a list of hotel IDs. It focuses on the `contentFields` and `providerPrefs` parameters.\n\n*   **contentFields** (string): Specifies which content blocks to return in the response.\n    *   **Supported Values**:\n        *   `Basic`: Returns a fundamental set of hotel details.\n        *   `All`: Returns all available content for a hotel. This is equivalent to requesting all other content fields combined.\n        *   `Facilities`\n        *   `MasterFacilities`\n        *   `NearByAttractions`\n        *   `Policies`\n        *   `Images`\n        *   `CheckInCheckout`\n        *   `Descriptions`\n        *   `Neighbourhoods`\n        *   `Fees`\n        *   `Reviews`\n        *   `Rooms`\n    *   You can combine values to get specific information. For example, requesting `Basic`, `Facilities`, and `Images` will return the basic hotel details plus the facilities and images in a single response.\n\n*   **providerPrefs** (array): Used to specify supplier preferences when the same hotel is available from multiple suppliers. The API returns static content from a single supplier, which is determined either by pre-configured preferencing or by the preferences provided in this field.\n\n#### **Response Details**\n\nThe response contains the hotel content details based on the requested `contentFields`.\n\n*   **Fields returned with `contentFields=Basic`**:\n    *   `Category`\n    *   `ChainCode`\n    *   `ChainName`\n    *   `Contact`\n    *   `Distance`\n    *   `GeoCode` (includes latitude/longitude)\n    *   `HeroImage`\n    *   `Id` (ZentrumHub's hotel ID)\n    *   `Language`\n    *   `Name`\n    *   `ProviderHotelId`\n    *   `ProviderId`\n    *   `ProviderName`\n    *   `RelevanceScore`\n    *   `Website`\n    *   `Type`\n    *   `StarRating`\n    *   `ImageCount`\n    *   `RatePlanTypes`\n    *   `Attributes`\n\n*   **Relevance Score**: The API returns a `relevanceScore` for each hotel, which is based on pre-configured biasing rules. You can sort the search results based on this score to display hotels with a higher relevance at the top of the list.\n\n#### **Use Cases from the Documentation**\n\n*   **Downloading Basic Content**: To get basic content for your local system (e.g., hotel ID, name, address, star rating, latitude/longitude, phone number), you must use the `getHotelContent` API. The documentation states there is no separate API for bulk-downloading static content. The `Basic` value for `contentFields` will provide most of these details.\n*   **Handling Multiple Suppliers**: If a hotel is available from multiple suppliers, the API returns static content from a single, preferred supplier. You can influence this selection by passing your supplier preferences in the `providerPrefs` field in the request.\n\n#### **Error Codes**\n\n*   **`4001`**: Invalid data in request - Please refer to the fields[] for more details.\n*   **`5000`**: Your request failed due to an unknown system error.
